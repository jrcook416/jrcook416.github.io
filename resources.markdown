One of the things that I do is teach certification courses for my agencies.  If you're just getting into teaching certification courses, you'll notice that beyond a basic curriculum, there's not much out there.  Here's some help:

<ol>
<li> The Indiana Department of Homeland Security picks training curriculum that supports the newest NFPA, DOT, or NREMT standards, and they often do this around six months to a year after the standards are released to the public.  The textbook publishers keep their materials consistent with the consensus standards so that you don't have to do the guesswork, as long as you're following their training plans.  Curriculum resources are often free to individual instructors or departments - contact the publisher's representative to get desk copies and curriculum.  As of March 14, 2024, the big two are IFSTA and Jones and Bartlett:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>John Konrad represents IFSTA.  You can call him at 310-625-7044 or reach him via email at konradj@osufpp.org. You will need to specify which books you're teaching from. 
		<br>IFSTA will usually provide you a paper desk copy OR electronic desk copy and access to ResourceOne, their learning management system. 
		<br>Please note that if you are not an established instructor, you'll need a letter from your Chief or municipality stating your qualifications and the authority to receive curriculum material - this often includes test bank information which is confidential. 
		<br>ResourceOne is free to all IFSTA students and instructors - all you will need to do to create a course is send John or the e-Products team an email and they will establish a new course copy just for you. </li>
		<li>Joy Knobbe represents Jones and Bartlett.  You can call her at 339-234-8494 or reach her via email at jknobbe@psglearning.com.  Like IFSTA, you will need to specify which books you're teaching from. 
		<br>You will also need to specify how many students you'll be teaching and when the class will be. Jones and Bartlett will usually provide you a paper desk copy OR electronic desk copy and curriculum electronically through Navigate. 
		<br>Unlike IFSTA, Jones and Bartlett charges for access to their learning management system.  The cost is built into each student textbook - you determine which level of features and access you'll be using.  BUT - once you create a course, it can be copied and re-launched as many times as you'd like. </li>
		<li>Regardless of whether you choose IFSTA or Jones and Bartlett, learning management systems take a lot of the work out of out-of-class activities, especially testing, and both publishers use Moodle - IFSTA uses it out of the box, and Jones and Bartlett has some extra functionality built in. Take the time and learn how Moodle works - it can be an indispensible part of your class.</li>
	</ul>
<li> Both the Fire and Public Safety Academy and EMS Section require a complete syllabus and schedule submitted prior to class listing on Acadis.  I have a few sample course syllabus documents here. </li></ol>

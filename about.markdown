Hi! I’m Jeremiah!

If you’re here, you’ve seen my work, web address, or just randomly stumbled across this dark, blind corner of the Internet.  At present, I am the Inventory System Specialist at [Indianapolis EMS](https://indyems.org) in Indianapolis, Indiana.

My journey has taken me plenty of places, from campsites all across Central Indiana, to the Kiel Center in St. Louis, from computer labs Downtown, to fire department training rooms across our great state.  I have two degrees which I earned backwards - a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from IUPUI, and an Associate’s of Applied Science in Fire Science (Magna cum Laude) from Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana.

younger me...">

I started my Informatics and Information Technology career as a Help Desk Associate, working Tier I support at the Office of Instructional Technology at the [University of Evansville](https://evansville.edu).  From OIT, I was recruited to WUEV-FM, UE’s radio station as their Director of Innovative Communication Technology.  Later at UE, I picked up three months running the Sports department at The Crescent, UE’s student newspaper, before struggling with my own mental illness and coming home to Indianapolis.

I worked some odd-jobs after coming home, including six months as a Out-States dispatcher at AAA Hoosier Motor Club, before joining the staff at the [IUPUI](https://iupui.edu) Department of Computer Science as the lead student engineer at the IUPUI Streaming Media Lab.  I was set to go after a Master’s in Informatics and New Media before one of our National Science Foundation projects was cancelled and my position was eliminated.

I worked in the restaurant business from graduation until my winding path led me to IEMS, where I have been for 11 years and 7 months, as of this writing.

From a chance encounter with a volunteer fire captain in the Summer of ‘07, I joined the Fire Service in a small town in rural South Central Indiana.  I quickly learned about the business and fell in love with the camaraderie and brotherhood, and quickly recognized how my unique skill-set could help men and women who step away from birthday dinners, Thanksgiving celebrations, and their families, to help random strangers on literally their worst days, seeking nothing but a $200 clothing allowance each year, and a small service pin after 10, 25, or 50 years of service.  

I run calls with those same guys and girls today, just to the west of where I started, as the Training Division Coordinator at the Gregg Township Fire Department, just outside Monrovia, Indiana.

This website is a living, breathing thing.  It is my mark, my legacy, that I’ve left on this life.  I hope that whoever comes here finds inspiration, motivation, or just plain has a good laugh.

Welcome!

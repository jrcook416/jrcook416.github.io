As we approach the closing months of 2023
and head towards the beginning of 2024, the future looks
very bright for me.  Indianapolis EMS is now a part-time
job, and I spend my days in the classrooms of Pike High School,
shaping and molding the next generation of EMS professionals.

About two years ago, I set up jrcookandassociates.net and jeremiahcook.net
to keep track of my journeys.  Not much content is here. That's
because I have spent a lot of time working and refining
my professional goals as an educator and a partner, as a father, and as a 
public safety professional.  

Yesterday was the first day in 16 years that I haven't worked
or been on call during Thanksgiving.  I woke up in the morning, I got
showered and dressed, I went to visit family with my partner, her kid, and my 
kid.  I woke up this morning with a new outlook on things. Life now is 
different.  I go to work, I come home, and I do my best to leave work at work and
home at home.  There are no late night phone calls about crises in response
or crashed websites, and my phone rarely rings after 8 pm.

It's nice. 

2024 is going to be a great year with new challenges and new opportunities. I
am working with some other public safety partners to continue to
improve the Pike EMS program and to bring the Instructor I education 
to a new audience. 

And yes, I'm going to try and be better about posting and blogging.

Like the title says, I'm back in the saddle, and I'm looking forward to
a great 2024.
